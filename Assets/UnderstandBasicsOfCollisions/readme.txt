Ten scenes for better understand the collisions:


A better understanding of collisions of Unity3D, through ten scenes with simple codes.
All codes are commented, and all the codes are as the most accessible and simple as possible, 
to better understand the different techniques available for managing collisions with Unity3D.

1-First Collision: simple collision between two cubes (stop when collision).
2-MultiCollision: evolution of a cube in the middle of a set of cubes
3-BulletCollisions: small turret exemple with a shot of type 'gun'.
4-BulletHowitzer: small turret exemple with a shot of type 'howitzer'. 
5-PullRay: small turret exemple with a shot of type 'gun' and a technique of  RayCast. 
6-DroidArena: Raycast detection for the movement of droids.
7-MultiDroidArena: Raycast detection for the movement of droids with mask detection.
8-FirstTrigger: first Trigger sample.
9-TriggerForGate: trigger sample, employee for open/close one door.
10-TriggerInScene: small level with simple control of the player, two doors and one lift.
